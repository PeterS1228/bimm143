## Class 09 Structural Bioinformatics

# PDB statistics

```{r}
db <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
db
```


> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy?

```{r}
xray.total <- sum(as.numeric(gsub(",", "", db$X.ray)))
em.total <- sum(as.numeric(gsub(",", "", db$em)))
```

Hmm... I am doing the same thing over and over. Time to write a function

```{r}
# I will work with `x` as input.

sum_comma <- function(x) {
  # Substitute the comma and convert to numeric
  sum(as.numeric(gsub(",", "", x)))
}
```

For Xray:
```{r}
sum_comma(db$X.ray)/sum_comma(db$Total)
```
For EM:
```{r}
round( sum_comma(db$EM)/sum_comma(db$Total), 2)
```


> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
round( sum_comma(db$Total[1])/sum_comma(db$Total), 2)
```

> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

Skipped

> Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

The structure is too low a resolution to see H atoms. You need a sub 1 angstron resolution to see Hydrogen. 

> Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

HOH308

# Working with Structures in R

We can use the `bio3d` package to read and perform bioinformatics calculations on PDB structures.

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```

```{r}
head (pdb$atom)
```

read an ADK structure

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

Perform a prediction of flexibility with a technique called NMA (normal analysis mode)

```{r}
# Perform flexiblity prediction
m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
```

Write out a "movie" (a.k.a trajectory) of the motion for viewing in MOLstar

```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```

> Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.

> Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object?

198

> Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues? 

HOH

> Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure? 

2
